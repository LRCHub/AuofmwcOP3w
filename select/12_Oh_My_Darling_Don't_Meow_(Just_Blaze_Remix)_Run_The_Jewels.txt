After a long night of drinking
And partying with fast women
With his good friend
El-P, Justin goes home to get some good
Rest he turns on the TV
And it's Cat Week what's the
Worst that could go wrong?
Hold up (Oh my)
Fuck the law they can eat my dick
That's word to Pimp
I don't fuck with or talk
Like all these fuckin' imps
Style violent, give a fuck if you deny it
Kids you can all run naked backwards
Through a field of dicks
Fuck the world don't ask me for shit
That's word to BIG
I dreamt we owned the world
But I've woken up, and it don't exist
Soak it in, I need no assist
You can't slap my wrist
I don't owe you shit
Trust me, I'm a Doctor DOOM
Oper-ate of my pulse, won't raise a bit
Tip-toe on the track like a ballerina
Ski mask in a Pontiac Catalina it's obese
Female opera singer you can run the
Jewels or lose your fingers
Me and El-P got time to kill
Got folks to kill on overkill
He hangin' out the window I hold
The wheel, one black, one white
We shoot to kill (Oh my God)
That fuckboy life about to be repealed that
Fuckboy shit about to be repelled
Fuckboy Jihad, kill infidels
Allah Akbar, BOOM, from Mike and El
Life is hell, death's a bitch
And these fubar rulers getting rich
I cop a zip, it opens up
I smoke it up, go home, and fuck
C'est la vie, girl, when in
Rome I gave the face, please pay with dome
My business card says
"You're in luck I do two
Things: I rap and fuck"
I fuck and rap, I tote the
Strap, I smoke the kush, i beat the puss
I read the books, did the math
Don't need a preacher preachin'
On my behalf
No teacher can teach, my arrogant
Ass, I'm blowin' on crippy
While readin' inscriptions
That's written by Egyptians, and sippin'
On whiskey! Ayy baby, you with me?
(Where am I? What is this?
What are these- What are
These cats doing?! What are
They doing?! Stop, please, no! STOP)
Oh my, don't cry oh my, don't cry
We run this spot, like a Chinese sweatshop
Don't stop, work it, work
It 'til chest pop - Cardiac arrested
I'm so invested, I'm self-invented
That no illusion, there's no confusion
You see the future, you fear the
Future, I've seen the truth
And I'm so deluded
I've been a better bad guy, than I been
Better than bad
Been a bit a bully talk, beating in my chest
In fact i'm a half stack, from a rack
I been around the block, babe
I know a few facts
Maniac, brainiac, run go, tell
Them that, ATLien, nY felon rap
Handle me wrong, I'm snappin' show
Up at your class, what's happenin'?
Schoolyard bully, with a fully automatic
Heart full of pain and a head
Full of havoc everybody stepped on the kid
And I'm letting them have it
Havoc, Leaving they momma, to say
"What happened!? Who gon' buy my baby a
Casket?" Fuck that bitch, i'm a bastard
Megablast, I'm mega lit, on Highway 6
And I'm not strapped in
I don't crash, bitch, I just skid
You got the cash? I'll make the trip
I make the trip, you better
Pay, done worse for less, don't make my day
I'm not from Earth, from far
Away, I bust through chests, like baby greys
Runnin' the jewels of the game
Whippin' the mix is, like chickens of 'caine
Spittin' the sentence again, parents
Is livid again, kids is just fuckin' insane
Pointin' that pistol and fist, for
The chain, reppin' the symbol
Like they in a gang
Delivery dope, like a dosage of dope, or
A noseful of coke, for a junkie, or fiend
(God, I promise I will never hang out
With the Run the Jewels again! El-P
What the fuck did you do to my drink)
Don't cry
(Why is fucking cats screaming at me?) oh my
(STOP) don't cry
(What the FUCK do you mean, "Don't cry?!")
