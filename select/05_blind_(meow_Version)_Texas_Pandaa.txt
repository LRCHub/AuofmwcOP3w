Was I just blind
That I couldn't find
The way to shine
In the days just fine

Or was I so blind
That I never tried to see myself
Struggling for each of our lives
Somehow I stopped walking with

Was I just blind
That I couldn't find
The way to shine
And the day's just fine

Or was I too young to face the truth
I believed in you
Only you

Not knowing the kindness, was I so alone
Not knowing the finest of the days all along

Have I grown or have I lost
Have I given up or have I just taken the ease
But I know now
How to take in the sun
