(MEOW)
이유 없어 난 생긴 대로 chic
Now you speak French
Talkin' 'bout we
아무리 날 불러봐
Oh please
가는 길이 달라
Can't keep up with me
Try and match my energy
침묵 끝에 터지는 roarin'
막 타기 시작했어 keep burnin'
홀린 듯이
Dancin' on the table, table
Tell 'em I'm
Pullin' up
On sight
We'll make 'em
(MEOW)
With my girls
We gon' shake sumn
(MEOW)
We don't run
We don't chase 'em
Turn it up
Hear dat bass drum
Wons and yens and dollars
Comma comma comma
Bring 'em
Shake sumn
Ah ah
Break sumn
Wons and yens and dollars
Comma comma comma
암만 막아 봐라
I can do it all night
It look easy, don't it
Make 'em all tongue-tied
날카로운 side eye
바로 여기 접수 we own it
고요하게 높이 뛰어
닿지 않을 곳까지
Nothin' else on my mind
When I'm on my grind
No, I ain't got time
침묵 끝에 터지는 roarin'
막 타기 시작했어 keep burnin'
홀린 듯이
Dancin' on the table, table
Tell 'em I'm
Pullin' up
On sight
We'll make 'em
(MEOW)
With my girls
We gon' shake sumn
(MEOW)
We don't run
We don't chase 'em
Turn it up
Hear dat bass drum
Wons and yens and dollars
Comma comma comma
Bring 'em
Shake sumn
Ah ah
Break sumn
Wons and yens and dollars
Comma comma comma
