My cat
Cool cat
Good cat
Pussycat

When I see him walking
It makes no sense to me
My cat is everywhere
We watch him on TV...

My cat is amazing
He can play the guitar
He may not be an actor
But hes a pussysuperstar...

My cat

Good cat
Pussycat

My cat is everywhere
Sees what he can see
He may not be an actor
He acts atrociously...

My cat is amazing
He can play the guitar
He may not be an actor
But hes a pussy superstar!...

My cat isn't crazy
He's everything to me
My cat burns the bible
And he thinks it's so funny...

He isn't very good
He isn't very smart
He may not be Picasso
But he is a work of art...

UH
